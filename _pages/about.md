I am Runwei Li, a dedicated researcher in the field of environmental science and atmospheric chemistry. My work focuses on air quality, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and their impact on human health and the environment. With a strong publication record in peer-reviewed journals, I strive to advance our understanding of atmospheric pollutants and develop innovative solutions for environmental challenges.
